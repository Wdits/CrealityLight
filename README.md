My goal with this extension was to bypass Creality Print’s “exclusive features.” I’ve always preferred Orca for my own reasons, but it doesn’t let you control the onboard camera light.

This extension fixes that, it sends a packet directly to your printer to toggle the onboard camera LED, simply by flipping a fancy switch on <PRINTER_IP>:8000. There’s also a Dark Mode toggle, because why not.

## Why would i want this?
You no longer need to use any apps just to toggle your printer’s camera light from your computer!
